                    <p>This weekâ€™s sleep patterns showed some major fluctuations, which definitely had an impact on my overall mood and energy levels. </p>
                    <p>Tuesday was the lowest point, with only 3 hours of sleep, and it was no surprise that I felt completely drained and unproductive that day. Wednesday, on the other hand, had the highest sleep duration at 7 hours, which gave me a much-needed boost. However, the inconsistency throughout the week made it difficult to feel fully rested.</p>
                    <p>For example, Thursday dropped back down to 4 hours, undoing any progress from the night before. Friday and Saturday were slightly better, averaging around 5â€“6 hours, but still not enough for optimal rest.</p>
                    <p>Even though Monday started off with 6.5 hours, the sharp decline on Tuesday set the tone for an unstable sleep schedule. By Sunday, I only got 4.8 hours, which wasnâ€™t the worst, but it still left me feeling sluggish. The overall trend highlights how irregular sleep patterns can take a toll, making it harder to stay energized and focused throughout the week.</p>

                    <p>Looking at my morning mood distribution this week, itâ€™s clear that there was a mix of feelings and energy levels to start each day. </p>
                    <p>The most common mood I experienced was "<strong>ðŸ¥´ Mentally Clocked Out</strong>", which occurred on 3 out of the 7 days. On these days, I felt overwhelmed, distracted, and just not mentally present, which affected my productivity early on. There were also a couple of days when I was "<strong>ðŸ‘¹ Certified Menace</strong>"â€”a mood where I felt edgy and irritable, and it was reflected in my behavior. This happened 2 days during the week, making me more reactive and less patient. </p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, I also had 1 day where I felt "<strong>ðŸŒž Golden Retriever Energy</strong>" where I was optimistic, excited, and ready to take on the world. It was a short burst of motivation, but it was refreshing when it happened. Lastly, there was 1 day when I was in my "<strong>ðŸ˜´ Human Snooze Button</strong>"" modeâ€”just physically and mentally sluggish, which made it tough to get up and do anything. Overall, the moods were all over the place, with mental fatigue and irritability taking the lead, but there were moments of bright energy and motivation in between.</p>

                    <p>
                        This week, I noticed a clear connection between my sleep patterns and how I felt emotionally and
                        mentally.</p>
                    <p>On <strong>Monday</strong>, with a solid <strong>85% sleep efficiency</strong>, I was able to
                        start the week feeling relatively energized and focused.</p>

                    <p>But by <strong>Tuesday</strong>, my sleep efficiency dropped to <strong>60%</strong>, and it
                        became obvious that the lack of rest
                        had a noticeable impact on my mood. I felt mentally foggy, drained, and less productive than
                        usual. </p>
                    <p><strong>Wednesday</strong> didnâ€™t offer much of a reprieve, with a <strong>70%</strong>
                        sleep efficiency, which meant that while I pushed through the day, I was still battling with low
                        energy and difficulty concentrating. </p>

                    <p>The real turning point came on <strong>Thursday</strong>,
                        when I got a <strong>90%</strong> sleep efficiency despite only having 4 hours of sleep, which
                        led to me feeling more balanced, sharp, and focused.</p>
                   
                    <p> On <strong>Friday</strong>, my efficiency
                        dropped slightly to <strong>75%</strong>, and although I didnâ€™t feel as great as Thursday, I
                        could still function and get things done. </p> 

                    <p>However, <strong>Saturday</strong> saw another dip to
                        <strong>65%</strong> efficiency, and I noticed a significant lack of energy, which made it hard
                        to stay focused.</p>

                    <p> By <strong>Sunday</strong>, I reached my lowest point with only
                        <strong>50%</strong> efficiency, and it left me feeling both physically and mentally drained,
                        struggling to stay engaged or motivated to tackle anything. The week as a whole really
                        highlighted how much my sleep impacts my overall well-being.
